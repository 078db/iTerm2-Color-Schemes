{"name":"Iterm2-color-schemes","body":"#iTerm Color Schemes#\r\n\r\n##Intro##\r\nThis is a set of color schemes for iTerm (aka iTerm2). Screenshots below and in the [screenshots](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes/tree/master/screenshots) directory.\r\n\r\nThe schemes Novel, Grass, Homebrew, Ocean, Pro, Man Page, Red Sands, and Terminal Basic are ports of the schemes of the same name included with the Mac Terminal application. All of Terminal's schemes have now been ported, with the excption of \"Solid Colors\" (random backgrounds, which iTerm doesn't support) and \"Aerogel\" (which is hideous).\r\n\r\nThe scheme idleToes was inspired by the [idleFingers](http://idlefingers.co.uk/) TextMate theme and suggested for inclusion by Seth Wilson.\r\n\r\nIf there are other color schemes you'd like to see included, drop me a line!\r\n\r\nBy the way, the color schemes with the dark backgrounds (Dark Pastel, Desert, etc.) look fantastic with a little bit of transparency. I have my slider set to the spot just under the A and R in \"Transparency\" on the Preferences->Window tab.\r\n\r\n##Installation Instructions##\r\nTo install:\r\n\r\n* Launch iTerm 2.
